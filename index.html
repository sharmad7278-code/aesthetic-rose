      Hey,<br><br>

      I don’t know the perfect words,  
      but I know the feeling behind them.<br><br>

      This rose isn’t about a single day 🌹  
      it’s about the calm, the warmth,  
      and the little happiness you bring without trying.<br><br>

      You have a way of making moments feel softer,  
      and days feel lighter.<br><br>

      So this is just a gentle reminder —  
      you are special, you matter,  
      and someone truly appreciates you.<br><br>

      Happy Rose Day ❤️
