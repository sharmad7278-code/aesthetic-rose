  Hey,<br><br>

  Some feelings don’t need big words.  
  They just need honesty.<br><br>

  This rose 🌹  
  isn’t about perfection,  
  it’s about the calm you bring,  
  the warmth that stays even when nothing is said.<br><br>

  You have this quiet way of making moments feel lighter,  
  and days feel a little more beautiful.<br><br>

  So this is just a gentle reminder —  
  you matter more than you know,  
  and someone truly, deeply appreciates you.<br><br>

  Always,<br>
